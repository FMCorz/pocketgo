Pockét GO
=========

The essential Pokémon GO companion app.

Introduction
------------

My goal for this app was to have the information I need available in an app rather than a website, and to present it a in more readable way than tabular data. This app will not contain a CP calculator, there are already hundreds of apps which do it, and probably do it very well.

This project served for me as a mean to learn more about React Native. It is open sourced so that hopefully others can learn from it. I'd also be very happy to see this project growing with the help of others.

Installation
------------

I haven't tried but I guess that you won't need much apart from adding your signing keys. More documentation later, hopefully.
